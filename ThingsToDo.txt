Parsing / Encounters branch:


1) Work on plotting the DPS/DTPS/TPS/HPS numbers and have "real-time" plotting. That is, being able to continuously plot as the text file is being updated.  Some combination of plt.show, plt.draw, and plt.pause should do the trick. Look into caching the background if this is too slow.

2) Build in the target list, with ability breakdown. Thus for each target note, what abilities used by/on them with what effect. 

3) Start building dictionary of special IDs for certain boss/special add encounters.

4) Test against actual updating combat log on my PC. Figure out key for identifying when new combat logs open up and automatically switch to them.
